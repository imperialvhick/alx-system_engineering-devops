This README.md files describes what each script available in this directory is doing
- 0-alias - creates an alias named: 'ls' with the value='rm*'
- 1-hello_you - prints hello user, where user is the current Linux user.
- 2-path - Add /action to the PATH. /action should be the last directory the shell looks into when looking for a program.
